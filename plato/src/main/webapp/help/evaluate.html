			<h2>Page overview</h2>
		</div>
		The initial view of this page provides you with
		<ul>
			<li>an objective tree on the upper left,</li>
			<li>a matrix of sample objects and experiment results on the
				lower left,</li>
			<li>and an empty space saying "No leaves selected" on the top
				right,</li>
		</ul>
		as shown below. <br /> <img src="screen-evaluate0.png"
			alt="Initial view" /> <br />
		<p>
			The task of this page is to provide all evaluation values for every
			criterion that you have defined in the tree.<br /> This means both
			experimental outcomes judging migration quality or the performance of
			an emulator, as well certain characteristics of the tool, the
			process, etc...<br /> Some of these evaluation values might be
			provided by automated measurement tools; we are working on increasing
			the percentage of these.<br /> However, currently you still have to
			enter many of them manually.<br /> The tree on the top left provides
			a way of selecting areas in the tree to filter the list of leaves. If
			you click on the root, the right side will disaply all leaves;<br />
			if you select a certain branch, it will display all leaf criteria in
			this branch.
		</p>

		<p>You can expand the tree on the top left to get the screen
			below:</p>
		<img src="screen-evaluate1.png" alt="Initial view with expanded tree" />
		<br />


		<p>Now selecting a node will display all leaf criteria under this
			node and prompt you for evaluation values.</p>
		<img src="screen-evaluate2.png" alt="Selection of leaves" />
		<p>
			To support the evaluation, you have full access to the original
			sample objects and the results that were created during the
			experiments - either uploaded by yourself or generated by
			preservation actions.<br /> You can download the original samples on
			the top of the table and each result file in the corresponding cell
			of the matrix.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can further get visual support for judging the quality of
			migration actions by comparing the charateristics of input and output
			files extracted by Jhove.<br /> Clicking on the matrix in the lower
			left will bring up a screen that shows the characteristics of
			original and converted objects side by side, as shown below.
		</p>
		<img src="screen-evaluate-jhove.png" alt="Selection of leaves" />
		<p>
			For reasons of traceability and auditing, Plato checks that each
			evaluation field has actually been entered. So you have to either
			manually specify a value for each field or <i>confirm</i> the
			evaluation data by clicking <em>Approve all values</em> before you
			can proceed to the next step.

		<p>If you have defined mappings to automated measurements in the
			objective tree, you will see the following button appear:</p>
		<div class="small">
			<img src="screen-evaluate-button.png"
				alt="Automated comparison button" />
		</div>
		<p>
			Clicking it executes the automated comparison engine based on the XCL
			tool suite. Please note that this works only for specific file
			formats and migration experiments.<br /> The defined mappings also
			appear in the list of leaves, with their full configuration
			description, as shown bellow.
