				<h2>General Information</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The 4-phase process consists of 14 steps. It starts with
				defining the preservation scenario, choosing sample records for
				experiments, and identifying the requirements and goals.</p>

			<p>The second part of the process consists of the definition and
				evaluation of potential preservation alternatives. Alternatives are
				therefore identified, including technical settings and required
				resources for running the experiments. The Go/No-Go-Decision
				enforces a review of the work in the previous steps. In the
				experiments the preservation alternatives are applied to the sample
				records. The final step of the second phase is the evaluation of the
				experimental outcomes against the requirements and goals defined in
				the first phase.</p>

			<p>In the third phase results of the experiments are aggregated
				to make them comparable, importance factors are set and the
				alternatives are ranked. The stability of the final ranking is
				analysed with respect to minor changes in the weighting and
				performance of the individual objectives using Sensitivity Analysis.
				After this consideration a clear and accountable recommendation can
				be made for one of the alternatives.</p>

			<p>In the fourth and final phase of the planning workflow a
				preservation plan based on the decision for a preservation action is
				created. It specifies a series of steps or actions along with
				organisational responsibilities, rules and conditions for executing
				the preservation action on the collection.</p>

			<p>The workflow shown in Figure 1 is described below in detail.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="define_basis">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>1. Define basis</h2>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>In the first step, the preservation scenario is described in a
				semi-structured way including the collection to be considered.
				Information about the collection includes details about the objects,
				number of objects in the collection, and legal requirements for
				handling the records. Moreover, the environment is described in
				which the preservation process takes place including institutional
				policies for preservation.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="define_sample_objects">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>2. Define sample objects</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In this step, a representative sample of records from the
				collection. The samples, usually between 5 and 10 objects, are later
				used on for evaluating the preservation alternatives.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="identify_requirements">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>3. Identify requirements</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The goal of this step is to define clearly the requirements
				and goals (objectives) for a preservation solution in a given
				domain. High-level goals are specified, collect detailed
				requirements, and organise them into a tree structure, referred to
				as the tree of objectives or shortly, ‘objective tree‘.</p>

			<p>While the resulting trees usually differ according to specific
				preservation context, some general principles can be observed. At
				the top level, the objectives can usually be organised into four
				main categories:</p>

			<ul style='margin-top: 0pt' type=disc>
				<li><i>Object characteristics </i> - describe the visual and
					contextual experience a user has when dealing with a digital
					object. Subdivisions may be ‘Appearance’, ‘Content’, ‘Structure’
					and ‘Behaviour’, with lowest level characteristics being  colour
					depth, image resolution, forms of interactivity, macro support, or
					embedded metadata.</li>
				<li><i>Record characteristics </i> - denote the technical
					foundations of a digital record, the context, interrelationships
					among records and metadata. A record can include one or more
					objects.</li>
				<li><i>Process characteristics </i> - refer to the preservation
					process. These include usability, complexity, or scalability.</li>
				<li><i>Costs </i>- have a significant influence on the choice
					of a preservation strategy. Usually and may usually be divided into
					technical and personnel costs-as or start-up and operational
					expenditures.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The objective tree is usually created in a workshop with
				experts from different domains contributing to the requirements
				gathering process. The tree is independent from the preservation
				actions that are considered. It models the requirements, not the
				actions to be taken. The tree documents the individual preservation
				requirements of an institution for a given collection of objects.
				Typical trees may contain from 50 up to several hundred objectives,
				usually organised in four to six hierarchy levels.</p>

			<p>Objective trees were initially created with post-it notes on a
				flip chart. Figure 3 shows an objective tree constructed with
				post-it notes.</p>

			<p>While this is convenient for certain environments, an
				alternative way has been introduced and the feedback on it has been
				very positive. This involves the use of mind-mapping software,
				usually projected onto a large screen to provide an overview, to
				allow multiple stakeholders working on the tree.</p>

			<p>Figure 4 shows a screenshot of an objective tree using
				mind-mapping software, which was edited during a preservation
				planning workshop.</p>

			<p>Having defined the objectives, the next step is to assign
				measures to each of the objectives in the tree, which provides
				metrics to determine how successful a requirement is met. Wherever
				possible, the metrics should be objectively quantifiable (e.g. € per
				year, frames per second). In some cases, (semi-) subjective scales
				are necessary, for example degrees of openness and stability,
				support of a standard, degree of file format acceptance within
				different communities.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="define_alternatives">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>4. Define alternatives</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Different preservation strategies, using for example
				migrations tools or emulators, are selected. A detailed description
				of each preservation alternative is provided. The description
				includes the software environment and parameters settings of the
				tool, in order to ensure a clear understanding of the alternative
				and allow a later re-evaluation of the planning process. For each
				defined alternative, the amount of work, time, and money required
				for running experiments is estimated.  </p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="take_go_decision">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>5. Take go decision</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Some experiments need a considerable amount of effort and
				required resources to run the experiments, for example experiment
				with great number of alternatives or high cost of hardware and
				software to run the experiments. Feasibility of the proposed
				alternatives are determined in this step by considering the defined
				requirements, the selected preservation alternatives, and estimated
				resources. The result is a decision for continuing the evaluation
				process or a justification of the abandonment or postponement of
				certain alternatives.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="develop_experiments">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>6. Develop experiments</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In the experiments, the preservation alternatives are applied
				to the previous defined sample records. The results of the
				experiments are later evaluated against the goals and requirements
				of the objective tree. In order to run repeatable tests, it is
				important to document all relevant experiment settings. This stage
				produces a specific development plan for each experiment, which
				includes the workflow, the software and hardware systems used for
				the experiments, and the mechanisms to capture the results. All
				items needed for the experiment will be developed and/or installed
				and tested, including copies of the sample objects, software
				packages and programs, and mechanisms for capturing the results.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="run_experiments">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>7. Run experiments</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Experiments are designed to test one or more aspects of a
				specific preservation alternative when applied to the previously
				defined sample records. Running an experiment produces results, for
				example converted computer files, revised metadata, and measured
				workload of the hardware. The results are evaluated in the next
				step.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="evaluate_experiments">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>8. Evaluate experiments</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The results of the experiments are evaluated to determine the
				degree to which the requirements defined in the objective tree were
				met. Therefore, the leaf objectives defined in the objective tree
				are evaluated with the defined measurement unit. For each
				alternative, the outcomes of this stage are measured performance
				values for each leaf in the objective tree.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="transform_measured_values">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>9. Transform measured values</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The measurements taken in the experiments might all be
				measured on different scales. In order to make these comparable,
				they are transformed to a uniform scale using transformation
				functions. These transformation functions can define thresholds or
				injective mathematic functions to map the measured values to the
				uniform scale. The resulting scale ranges from zero to five. A value
				of zero denotes an unacceptable result and thus serves as a dropout
				criterion for the whole preservation alternative.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="set_importance_factors">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>10. Set importance factors</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Not all of the identified objectives are equally important and
				different degrees of conformance of a solution are accepted in
				different objectives. This step assigns importance factors to each
				objective depending on the specific preferences and requirements in
				the scenario.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="analyse_results">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>11. Analyse results</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In this step, the performance measures for the individual
				objectives are aggregated to one single comparable value for each
				alternative. Currently the following methods are available:</p>

			<ul style='margin-top: 0pt' type=disc>
				<li>Sum – The measured performance values, as transformed by
					the transformation functions, are multiplied by the weighting
					factor. These values are summed up to a single comparable value per
					alternative. Leaf values that score zero (measured performance
					under required minimum threshold) have no decisive effect on the
					final root value.</li>
				<li>Multiplication – The first step here is to multiply the
					comparable value per leaf by the weight of that leaf. The results
					are then multiplied throughout the tree for the whole alternative.
					The multiplication method highlights alternatives with drop out
					values, as these alternatives with leaf values zero have a final
					root value of zero.</li>
				<li>Sum of Advantages – This aggregation allows the comparison
					of two alternatives against each other, it is a comparative
					comparison of two alternatives. The DELOS Testbed (6) has
					implemented the aggregation function Sum of Priority, which is
					based on integer numbers. Because we introduced real numbers for
					the uniform scale in the Planets approach, this aggregation is not
					feasible. <br> The newly introduced Sum of Advantage function
					supports the comparison of real numbers. Each alternative’s leaf
					value is compared to the leaf values of the other alternative. The
					final value for the alternative with the higher leave value is the
					difference, the final value for other alternative is zero. These
					values are summed up over the tree and form a final value for each
					alternative. The final values of an alternative show the difference
					of the performance compared to the other alternative.<br> <br>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We thus obtain aggregated performance values for every part of
				the objective tree for each alternative, including an overall
				performance value at the root level.</p>

			<p>A first ranking of the alternatives can be done based on the
				final root values associated with each alternative. This ranking is
				based on the specific requirements of the preservation context. It
				forms the basis for a documented and accountable selection of a
				specific preservation alternative. Furthermore, an analysis of all
				parts of the objective tree can identify the strengths and weakness
				of an alternative.</p>

			<p>In addition to ranking, Sensitivity Analysis may be performed
				by analysing, for example, the stability of the ranking with respect
				to minor changes in the weighting of the individual objectives, or
				to minor changes in the performance. This will result in a stability
				value for each alternative and each objective, which may further
				influence the final decision.</p>

			<div class="anchor" id="create_executable_plan">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>12. Create executable plan</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>This step of the workflow defines the triggers for the
				execution and under what conditions the preservation action will be
				carried out. Hard- and software requirements as well as dependencies
				to other systems are documented. For execution of the preservation
				plan tool settings and details about the location of the collection
				on which the action is to be performed are defined.</p>
			<p>To quality assure the performed actions a subset of the
				criteria used for evaluating solutions can be selected. These
				criteria will then be extracted by using characterization services
				on the objects after the performed action and testing, if defined
				thresholds of these criteria are met. The necessary documentation
				that has to be recorded for performing the action is also defined in
				this step.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="define_preservation_plan">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>13. Define preservation plan</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>While most parts of the preservation planning workflow take
				care of the technical aspects of the preservation plan, this step
				mainly defines the organisational details.</p>
			<p>Cost factors influence the decision on a specific alternative.
				In this step a more detailed calculation of costs using an approved
				cost model is performed. Cost models that can be used are for
				example Life2 or the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model. While an
				estimate of the costs may be fine for evaluating the alternatives,
				the costs have to be determined as accurate as possible in this
				step.</p>
			<p>The assignments of responsibilities is also documented in this
				step. Monitoring the process of applying the preservation actions
				has to be done by a different role than executing the preservation
				plan. It also has to be monitored if an event occurs that makes it
				necessary to reevaluate the plan. Possible triggers for this are
				either a scheduled periodic review, changes in environment such as
				new available tools detected through technology watch, changed
				objectives (changed target community requirements) or a changed
				collection profile (e.g. new objects in the collection). Another
				possible trigger is that certain tresholds on the evaluation are no
				longer met by applying the preservation action.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<div class="anchor" id="validate_plan">
				<div class="sectiontitle">
					<h2>14. Validate plan</h2>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In the final stage the whole documentation about the
				preservation plan has to be reviewed. The process of evaluating
				different alternatives and taking a decision for a recommended tool
				based on the evaluation and the creation of the preservation action
				plan, the documentation about the basic framework of the institution
				and parameters under which the plan is valid are verified again.</p>
			<p>Tests on a defined set of sample objects are performed in this
				step to check the validity of the preservation plan and the
				preservation action plan.</p>
			<p>Finally the validated plan has to be approved by the person
				responsible for approval. Once the plan is approved, no more changes
				on the plan should be done without revising the whole plan.</p>

			<p>The result of the preservation planning process described
				above is a complete preservation plan. It consists of a concise,
				objective, and well-documented ranked list of preservation
				alternatives for a given preservation context, considering
				institution-specific requirements. By providing both overall and
				detailed performance measures, based on the standardised and
				repeatable experiments, it allows the selection of most suitable
				preservation strategy. Based on this selection a complete
				preservation plan for performing the preservation action can be
				defined.</p>
