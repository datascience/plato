		<p>This page explains what types of experiments exist and how to
			run them.</p>

		In this step, all considered preseration actions are applied to all
		sample objects, and the outcomes are documented in detail.<br />
		Correspondingly, this page provides a list of considered preservation
		actions at the top, similar to the view at <i>Develop experiment</i>.
		The difference is that for preservation action <i>services</i>, you
		will find a little <i>play</i> button like in a multimedia player:<br />
		<img src="../img/play-blue-small.png" alt="Play button" /><br />
		Clicking this button will bring up a modal window for running the
		selected service. Clicking the green arrow in that window starts the
		experiments:<br /> <img src="screen-runmigration.png"
			alt="Experiment execution" /><br /> Clicking the green checkmark
		closes the window. <br /> The experiment status as indicated by the
		icons can be one of the following:
		<ul>
			<li><img src="../img/icons/small/false.png" alt="Failed" />
				means the experiment has failed.<br /></li>

			<li><img src="../img/icons/small/not-known.png" alt="Unknown" />
				means the experiment has not been executed yet.<br /></li>
			<li><img src="../img/icons/small/true.png" alt="Success" />
				means the experiment has not executed successfully.<br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can run all automated actions at once using the button at
			the bottom:</p>
		<img src="runall.png" alt="Run all actions" /><br />
		<p>
			If you have been running actions that use quality-aware services,
			such as minimee services, you will find a new link saying <i>Show
				migration result metadata</i> below this button after the experiments
			have finished. <br /> Activating it displays the measurements
			obtained from these services in a separate windows.
		</p>

		<p>The lower part of the screen contains the results of
			experiments, i.e. the resulting files after the experiments have been
			run. (eg. for migration the migrated files). For migration web
			services that are executed by the planning tool, these files we be
			retrieved automatically. For all experiments that you are carrying
			out yourself, please upload all resulting files and documentation
			here.</p>
