			<h2>Why policies?</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Organizations differ in many ways, type, size, direction, just
			to to name a few. That's why apart from technical and intellectual
			properties of digital objects also the strategy, policy, goals and
			constraints of the institution are an integral part of the
			preservation plan.</p>
		<p>Usually organizations have created documents describing their
			policies, strategies, workflows, plans, and goals to provide
			guidance.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section" id="policies_template">
		<div class="sectiontitle">
			<h2>The policies template</h2>
		</div>
		<p>In the course of the Planets project a conceptual model of
			organizational digital preservation policies and strategies has been
			created. It incorporates relevant organisational characteristics and
			strategic directions to support the planning process in digital
			preservation projects.</p>
		<p>
			Relevant policies have been structured in tree form which can be used
			as a template for defining your organizational policies. The template
			can be downloaded here: <a
				href="/plato/website/docs/PP2-Policy-template.mm">&gt;Policy
				template&lt;</a>

			<h2>How to create a policy tree</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Based on the policy tree you can model you policies by
			replacing the leaves, which denote the scale of the policy, by their
			actual values. You should remove policies you don't have in place by
			simply removing the node forming the policy.</p>
		<p>
			In the tree, policies have been grouped into several levels, as for
			instance shown in the screenshot below. The screenshot shows policies
			pertaining to <i>Preservation Action</i>. Leaves in the tree denote
			scales the particular policy can be measured in. Policy <i>Preservation
				Action must be emulation</i> can be answered either <i>Yes</i>, or <i>No</i>.

		<p>After all scales have been replaced by their actual values, the
			policy tree might look like follows:</p>

	<div class="section" id="policies_upload">
		<div class="sectiontitle">
			<h2>Upload the policy XML file</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The workflow step 'Define Basis' allows to upload the policy
			tree which has been saved as Freemind file (.mm).</p>
		<div class="small">
			<img src="PP2-freemind-policy-fileupload.png"
				alt="Define Basis Upload" title="Policy file upload" />
		</div>
		<p>After the tree has been uploaded (by pressing the button
			'Upload File') Plato displays the tree and allows you to store the
			policies with the preservation project.</p>
