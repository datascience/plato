			<h2>Why Aggregation?</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			A single value for every alternative has to be calculated to rank the
			alternatives. This is done by calculating up the <b>transformed</b>
			values on the leaves of the requirements tree by using one of the
			aggregation methods listed below.
		</p>

		<div class="sectiontitle">
			<h2 class="title2">Aggregation Methods</h2>
		</div>
		The following methods for aggregation are included:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Multiplication</b> <br />Here, the first step is to
				raise the comparable value per leaf to the weight of that leaf. The
				results are then multiplied throughout the tree for the whole
				alternative. The final ranking is based on a rational scale. The
				multiplication method highlights alternatives with drop out values,
				as these alternatives with leaf values zero have a final root value
				of zero.</li>
			<li><b>Sum</b><br />The comparable values are multiplied by
				their weights. These values are summed up to a single comparable
				value per alternative. The sum method offers a final ranking on a
				rational scale. Leaf values that score zero (drop-out value) have no
				decisive effect on the final root value.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Sum shows an overall ranking of an alternative. The
			Multiplication considers unacceptable values (leaf value of zero) as
			well. The aggregated value for the containing branch and the
			alternative are set to zero as well.<br /> Thus, we use
			multiplication to eliminate alternatives with unacceptable
			performance, and addition to rank the remaining options.

		<p>
			Below is an example of how an alternative is set to zero because of
			an unacceptable value with aggregation method "Multiplication". <br />
