# Plato: The Preservation Planning Tool

Efficient and trustworthy preservation planning.

## What does Plato do?

Plato is a decision support tool which guides you through the preservation planning workflow.
To do this efficiently it integrates information from external sources like control policies, content-profiles, and component registries; it can run these components to automate tool evaluation, and connects to repositories via open interfaces.
During this process Plato collects all the information to enable the planner to take an informed decision, and finally generates an evidence-based preservation plan which can be executed on suitable platforms.

## What are the benefits for the end user?

Plato brings you the following benefits:

* Guidance through the preservation planning process
* Trustability through controlled experiments and documentation
* Policy aware planning
* Using [standardized measures](purl.org/DP/quality/measures)
* [myExperiment](http://www.myexperiment.org/) and Taverna integration: Share migration, quality assurance, and characterisation components with the community
* Connects to repositories using [open interfaces](https://github.com/openplanets/scape-apis)
* Provides a plan executable on your content
* Enables on-going monitoring by creating triggers for [Scout](https://github.com/openplanets/scout)
